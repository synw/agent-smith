# Git

![pub package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@agent-smith/feat-git)

Manage git commits with a language model

## Install

```bash
npm i -g @agent-smith/feat-git
```

Add the plugin to your `config.yml` file and run the `conf` command to update the cli.

```yml
plugins:
  - "@agent-smith/feat-git"
```

```bash
lm conf
```

## Usage

Use the <kbd>commit</kbd> command: in a git repository with uncommited
or staging modifications:

```bash
lm commit
```

With options:


```bash
lm commit src
```

The model will generate the whole message. To use a custom first line message:


```bash
lm commit --msg "Custom first line"
```

The command will prompt the user to commit or not once the message is generated

### Variables

Optional variables are available.

To give additionnal instructions to the model:

```bash
lm commit --instructions "Omit the version number change"
```

To use a package name in the generated first line message:

```bash
lm commit --pkg "git plugin"
```

## Models

The default model is qwencoder 30b a3b. To use another model:

```bash
lm commit -m mymodel
```

With template:

```bash
lm commit -m "gemma3:4b-it-q8_0" -t "gemma"
```

Format: `-m modelname -t templatename`. If the template name is omitted it will
be guessed (works with most well known models), example:

```bash
lm commit -m "deepseek-coder-v2:16b-lite-instruct-q8_0"
```

In this example the Deepseek v2 template will be guessed
