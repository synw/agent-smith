# Templates

The model to used is defined in the `model` section. The template to use
with this model must be defined in the `template` section. Minimal example:

```yml
model:
    name: mistral:instruct
    ctx: 4092
template: 
    name: mistral
```

## System message

It is possible to define a system message for the templates that support it:

```yml
model: 
    name: "llama3.1:latest"
    ctx: 8192
template: 
    name: llama3
    system: |- 
        You are an AI programmer assistant
```

Or to append to an existing system message:

```yml
template: 
    name: llama3
    afterSystem: |- 
        \nImportant: always answer in markdown
```

## Stop words

To define stop words:

```yml
model: 
    name: "llama3.1:latest"
    ctx: 8192
template: 
    name: llama3
    stop:
        - "finished"
        - "terminated"
```

Here the model will stop emitting if it encounters any of the stop words "finished" or "terminated".

Note: the model's EOS tokens are automatically added to the stop list from the template.

## Assistant block

It is possible to start the assistant's response with some text, so that the model can continue it:

```yml
prompt: |-
      Create a commit message from this git diff:

      ```
      {prompt}
      ```
template: 
    name: llama3
    stop:
        - |-
            ```
    assistant: |-
            Here is the commit message:
            
            ```text
```

Here the assistant will start his response directly with the commit message, and will
stop emitting when it will encounter a "```" token, so that the response will be only
the commit message, preventing the model from further commenting.

## Shots

To use in context learning we can provide a few shots to the model:

```yml
template: 
    name: deepseek
prompt: |-
    in Python create a detailed and helpful Google style docstring for this code:

    ```python
    {prompt}
    ```
model:
    name: deepseek:6.7b
    ctx: 8192
shots:
    - user: |-
          in Python create a detailed and helpful Google style docstring for this code:

          ```python
          def add(a: float, b: float = 2.5) -> float:
            if a < 0:
                raise ValueError("Provide a positive number for a")
            try:
                return a + b
            except Exception as e:
                raise (e)
          ```

          Always provide a short example in the docstring. The code is formatted with Black. 
          Important: output only the docstring    
      assistant: |-
          """
          Sums two float numbers, but ensures the first number is non-negative. If the
          second number is not provided, it defaults to 2.5.

          Args:
              a (float): The first number to be added. Must be a non-negative float.
              b (float, optional): The second number to be added. Defaults to 2.5. Can be
                  any float.

          Returns:
              float: The sum of a and b.

          Raises:
              ValueError: If \`a\` is negative.
              Exception: Any unexpected error that might occur during addition.

          Example:
              >>> add(2.5)
              5.0
              >>> add(2.5, 3.5)
              6.0
              >>> add(-1.0)
              ValueError: Provide a positive number for a
          """
```

In this example adding a shot will teach the model the desired output format and requirements, helping
it to generate the correct response format for the user query
