# Variables

A task must have a `{prompt}` variable defined in the `prompt` section:

```yaml
prompt: |-
    Create a commit message from this git diff:

    ```
    {prompt}
    ```
```

## Optional variables

The additional variables are declared in a `variables` section. Each variable has to be defined
in the prompt:

```yaml
prompt: |-
    Create a commit message from this git diff:

    ```
    {prompt}
    ```

    {instructions}
variables:
    optional:
        instructions:
            description: Optional additional instructions
```

Here we have an extra optional `instructions` variable declared. If it is not provided
at execution time it will be skipped from the prompt. Example:

```ts
await task.run({
    prompt: "a git diff text",
    instructions: "Avoid signing the commmit. Think carefully before you write your commit message."
});
```

## Required variables

The additional variables are declared in a `variables` section. Each variable has to be defined
in the prompt:

```yaml
prompt: |-
    Create the details of the commit message. Here is the first line describing
    the purpose of the commit:

    ```
    {msg}
    ```

    Here is the git diff

    ```
    {prompt}
    ```
variables:
    required:
        msg:
            description: The first line of the commit message
```

If the required variable is not present when calling `run` it will raise an error. 

Example:

```ts
await task.run({
    prompt: "a git diff text",
    msg: "Update the documentation in the readme"
});
```
