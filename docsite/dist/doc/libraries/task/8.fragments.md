# Fragments

Fragments are a way to include content from some files into the prompt. Example: I have a somecode.py file
that I want to include in a prompt:

```yaml
prompt: |-
    I have some code:
    
    ```python
    {file:../somecode.py}
    ```

    {prompt}
# ...
```

The file path is relative to the task file path, or absolute.

## Install

This feature is Nodejs only. To use it use the `@agent-smith/nodetask` package
instead of the standard `@agent-smith/task`:

```ts
import { TaskDef} from "@agent-smith/task";
import { NodeTask} from "@agent-smith/nodetask";

const task = new NodeTask.fromYaml(agent, ymlTaskDef as TaskDef);
```
