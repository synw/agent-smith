# Basic agent

Create an minimal agent:

```ts
import { useAgentSmith } from "@agentsmith/body";

const joe = useAgentSmith({
    name: "Bob",
});
```

## Interactions

The agent can manage the state of user intactions. This uses reactive variables
and is suitable to work in frontend.

### Talk

This moves the state of the agent to talking. 

```ts
joe.talk("Hello, I am joe", 5);
```
