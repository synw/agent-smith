# Overview

The terminal client is a runtime to execute simple tasks or more complex pipelines
involving language models. Principles:

- **Declarative**: the features to execute are declared in an easy to edit human readable format
- **Composable**: compose tasks, actions, jobs and custom commands

## Features

Different type of features can be declared: tasks, actions, jobs and commands.

### Tasks

A task is a language model predefined query: the prompt, template, sampling paramaters and model
are preset for the task. The format to declare a task is yaml. Quick example:

```yaml
name: explain
description: Explain code
prompt: |-
      I have this code:

      ```
      {prompt}
      ```

      Explain what the code does in details
template: 
    name: deepseek
    system: You are an AI programmer assistant
model:
    name: deepseek-coder:6.7b
    ctx: 8192
inferParams:
    min_p: 0.05
    temperature: 0.2
```

## Actions

An action is a system command or custom code run. It is used to retrieve or process data. An action can be:

- A system command
- A Javascript script
- A Python script

A system command is declared in yaml. Example:

```yaml
cmd: git
args:
  - diff
```

A Javascript command returns an <a href="javascript:openLink('/libraries/jobs/create_a_job')">AgentTask</a>:

```js
import { useAgentTask } from "@agent-smith/jobs";
import { execute } from "@agent-smith/cli";

const action = useAgentTask({
    id: "git_diff",
    title: "Git diff",
    run: async (args) => {
        const diff = await execute("git", ["diff", ...args]);
        let msg = diff;
        const stagedDiff = await execute("git", ["diff", "--staged", ...args]);
        if (stagedDiff.length > 0) {
            msg += "\n" + stagedDiff
        }
        return { ok: true, data: { prompt: msg } }
    }
});

export { action }
```

A Python command is just a Python script:

```python
print("result data")
```

## Workflows

A workflow is a suite of actions and tasks. It is declared in yaml:

```yaml
title: "Generate a git commit message from a git diff"
steps:
  - action: git_diff
  - task: commit_msg
```

The result of the action is automatically passed as a parameter
for the next step: here the git diff message is passed to the language model task

## Commands

All the tasks, actions, jon and commands can run in interactive cli mode or as single commands. 
Run the `lm` command to launch the client, and then run commands. Example to list the available
tasks:

```bash
lm
> tasks
```

Example of the same command as single terminal command:

```bash
lm tasks
```

Custom commands are scripts used to run multiple steps pipelines. Some
functions are available to manage the interactivity with the user.
