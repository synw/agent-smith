# Workflows

A workflow is a pipeline of tasks and actions that run in a sequence. It is
is defined in yaml.

Example `features/workflows/commit_msg.yml` workflow that uses
the `features/actions/git_diff.js` action and the `features/tasks/commit_msg.yml` task:

```yaml
title: "Generate a git commit message from a git diff"
steps:
  - action: git_diff
  - task: commit_msg
```

Note: the result of an action or task is passed to the next one.

## Adaptaters

An adaptater is a javascript script that manipulates data between
two workflow tasks, often to convert data and adapt required formats.

Adaptaters are declared in a `adaptaters`Â folder of a plugin. Example: an
adaptater to parse command line input. The <kbd>q</kbd> wokflow from the
<a href="javascript:openLink('/plugins/inference')">inference plugin</a>.
Workflow:

```yaml
steps:
  - adaptater: prequery
  - task: infer
```

The adaptater parses the command line arguments and dispatch them for the `infer` task
that will run next in the workflow:

```js
import { parseTaskVars } from "@agent-smith/cli";

async function action(args, options) {
    const { vars } = parseTaskVars(args);
    let buf = [];
    args.forEach(arg => {
        if (!arg.includes("=")) {
            buf.push(arg);
        }
    });
    const res = { prompt: buf.join(" "), ...vars };
    return res;
}

export { action }
```
