# Workflows

A workflow is a pipeline of tasks and actions that run in a sequence. It is
is defined in yaml.

Example `features/workflows/commit_msg.yml` workflow that uses
the `features/actions/git_diff.js` action and the `features/tasks/commit_msg.yml` task:

```yaml
title: "Generate a git commit message from a git diff"
steps:
  - action: git_diff
  - task: commit_msg
```

Note: the result of an action or task is passed to the next one.
