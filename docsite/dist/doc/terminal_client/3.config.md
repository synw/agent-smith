# Config

The custom features (tasks, workflows, actions and commands) are located either
in a local folder or in a js plugin.

You can declare your custom features in a config file.
Create a `features/config.yml` file:

```yml
promptfile: /home/me/lm/features/prompt.txt
features:
  - /home/me/lm/features/dist
plugins:
  - "@agent-smith/feat-git"
```

All are optional. The promptfile is a file that can be used for input for
inference tasks. See the <a href="javascript:openLink('/terminal_client/tasks')">tasks</a>
section for more info about input modes.

Update your client config using this file by running this command:

```bash
lm conf ~/lm/features/config.yml
```

## Local features

The features are declared in a folder (here `/home/me/lm/features/dist`) using
these subfolders:

- actions
- tasks
- workflows
- cmds

All are optional.

Every new feature will be detected at startup and available
