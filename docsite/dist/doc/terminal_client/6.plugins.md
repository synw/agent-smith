Custom client features can be distributed as a npm plugin.

- `@agent-smith/feat-git` a command to use a language model to generate a commit message.

npm i -g @agent-smith/feat-git
```

Add the plugin to your `config.yml` file

```yml
plugins:
  - "@agent-smith/feat-git"
```

Download the Llama 3.1 model used in this plugin:

```bash
ollama pull llama3.1:latest
```

Update your client config by running this command:

```bash
lm conf ~/lm/features/config.yml
```

To use the plugin run the `commit` command in a git repository:

```bash
lm commit
# or
lm commit .
# or
lm commit src
```

## Create a plugin

Create an npm package with a `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "agent-smith-myplugin",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "Description of the plugin",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@agent-smith/cli": "^0.0.1",
    "@agent-smith/jobs": "^0.0.5"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@commander-js/extra-typings": "^12.1.0",
    "@locallm/types": "^0.0.16",
    "@types/node": "^20.12.12",
    "ts-node": "^10.9.2",
    "tslib": "2.6.2",
    "typescript": "^5.4.5"
  },
  "type": "module"
}
```

Use the standard directory structure for your features in a `dist` directory:

- actions
- commands
- jobs
- tasks

For the development declare your features as a local folder:

```yml
features:
  - /home/me/lm/agent-smith-myplugin/dist
```

Update your client config by running this command:

```bash
lm conf ~/lm/features/config.yml
```

Once your features completed and the plugin published to npm install it
globally:

```bash
npm i -g agent-smith-myplugin
```

Declare it as a plugin in your cli config:


```yml
plugins:
  - "agent-smith-myplugin"
```

Rerun the `lm conf` command to update
