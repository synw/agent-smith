# Tasks

A task is a prompt for a language model, defined in yaml

## List tasks

The `lt` command, see the example above

## Read a task

To read a task details:

```bash
lm rt mytask
```

It will display the task in json

## Run a task

```bash
lm mytaskname "param 1"
```

For an `infer.yml` task:

```yml
name: infer
description: A test inference task
template: 
    name: mistral
prompt: |-
    {prompt}
model:
    name: mistral:instruct
    ctx: 4092
inferParams:
    min_p: 0.05
    temperature: 0.2
```

All the tasks require a prompt parameter. To run this task with a custom prompt:

```bash
lm infer "List the planets in the solar system"
```

## Inference parameters

To see the full [list of parameters](https://synw.github.io/agent-smith/lm_task/specification) 
check the LmTask package documentation

## Model override

To use a different model than the one specified in the task use
the `m` parameter:

```bash
lm infer "List the planets in the solar system" m="phi3.5:latest"
```

The program will try to guess the template to use, based on the name of
the model. It works for well known models. To specify a template:

```bash
lm infer "List the planets in the solar system" m="some_model.gguf/chatml"
```

## System prompt

Use the template section to add a system prompt:

```yaml
name: tsdoc
description: Create a Jsdoc docstring for a block of code
template: 
    name: chatml
    system: |-
        You are an AI programming assistant. Your task is to create detailled and helpful
        documentation.
```

## Assistant block and stop tokens

To make the assistant response start use the template block,. It is useful for 
better autocomplete and formating in some cases:

```yaml
template: 
    name: deepseek2
    system: |-
        You are an AI programming assistant. Your task is to create detailled and helpful
        documentation.
    stop:
        - "```"
    assistant: |-
        Here is the docstring:

        ```ts
```

## Shots

It is possible to use few shots prompting in a task definition. Example with
a create Python docstring task:

```yaml
name: py_docstring
description: Create a Google style docstring for Python code
prompt: |-
    in Python create a detailed and helpful Google style docstring for this code:

    ```python
    {prompt}
    ```

    Always provide a short example in the docstring. The code is formatted with Black. 
    Important: output only the docstring
template: 
    name: deepseek2
model:
    name: DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct-Q8_0
    ctx: 8192
inferParams:
    min_p: 0.05
    temperature: 0
shots:
    - user: |-
          in Python create a detailed and helpful Google style docstring for this code:

          ```python
          def add(a: float, b: float = 2.5) -> float:
            if a < 0:
                raise ValueError("Provide a positive number for a")
            try:
                return a + b
            except Exception as e:
                raise (e)
          ```

          Always provide a short example in the docstring. The code is formatted with Black. 
          Important: output only the docstring
          
      assistant: |-
          """
          Sums two float numbers, but ensures the first number is non-negative. If the
          second number is not provided, it defaults to 2.5.

          Args:
              a (float): The first number to be added. Must be a non-negative float.
              b (float, optional): The second number to be added. Defaults to 2.5. Can be
                  any float.

          Returns:
              float: The sum of a and b.

          Raises:
              ValueError: If \`a\` is negative.
              Exception: Any unexpected error that might occur during addition.

          Example:
              >>> add(2.5)
              5.0
              >>> add(2.5, 3.5)
              6.0
              >>> add(-1.0)
              ValueError: Provide a positive number for a
          """
```

## Variables

A task always take a `prompt` input. It is possible to add custom variables in
the prompt. 

### Required variables

```yaml
name: commit_msg
description: Create a commit message from a git diff
prompt: |-
      Create a the details of the commit message. Here is the first line describing
      the purpose of the commit:

      ```
      {msg}
      ```

      Here is the git diff:

      ```
      {prompt}
      ```

      Avoid signing the commmit. Important: output only the commit message, no other comments.
      Think carefully before you write your commit message.
variables:
    required:
        - msg
```

Here the `msg` variable is required. Note: this example is used in a job
where the git diff is an action:

```yaml
title: "Generate a git commit message from a git diff"
tasks:
  - type: "action"
    name: "git_diff"
  - type: "task"
    name: "commit_msg"
```

See the jobs section for more info.

### Optional variables

```yaml
name: a_task
prompt: |-
      Some prompt text.

      ```
      {prompt}
      ```

      Some prompt text. {instructions}
variables:
    optional:
        - instructions
```

Here the `instructions` variable is optional
