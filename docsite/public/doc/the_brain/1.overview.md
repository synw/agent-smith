# Overview

The brain of Agent Smith is made of one or several language models. It connects to
inference servers to make queries and deliver results.

## Supported servers

The brain module works with these local or remote inference servers:

- [Llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/tree/master/examples/server)
- [Koboldcpp](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp)
- [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama)

Advice if you have none of these servers available: download a release of Koboldcpp or Ollama,
it's very easy to install and run.
