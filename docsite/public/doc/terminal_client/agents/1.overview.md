# Agents

An agent definition is similar to a task, with the ability to call tools.

- <a href="javascript:openLink('/terminal_client/agents/tools_call')">Tool calls</a>: local tools from other *tasks*, *actions* or *workflows*
- <a href="javascript:openLink('/terminal_client/agents/mcp')">Mcp servers</a>: use tools from mcp servers
- <a href="javascript:openLink('/terminal_client/agents/subagents')">Sub agents</a>: use agents inside other agents
- <a href="javascript:openLink('/terminal_client/agents/tools_routing')">Tools routing agents</a>: grouped tool calls

The agent can use a user defined tools set, autonomously or in a supervised way, asking the user for permission. Each tool has
it's own permissions.
