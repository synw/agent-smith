}
```

Use the standard directory structure for your features in a `dist` directory:

- models
- actions
- commands
- workflows
- tasks

All directories are optional. For the development declare your features as a local folder:

```

Update your client config by running this command:

```bash
lm conf ~/lm/features/config.yml
```

Once your features completed and the plugin published to npm install it
globally:
