# Tools call

The tasks can use tools call. A tool can be defined from another action, task or wokflow.

## Action tools

Check the `examples/tools.js` example in the repository for full code.

We will define two actions tools. The first one, `weather.py`, in an `action` folder:

```python
"""
# tool
name: weather
description: Get the current weather
arguments:
    city:
        description: The city or location, e.g. San Francisco, CA
"""

# Fake action
print('{"temp": 18, weather: "rain"}')
```

Note the comment on top that describes the action for the model. Second action tool, `traffic.js`:

```js
/*
# tool
name: traffic
description: Get the current road traffic conditions
arguments:
    city:
        description: The city or location, e.g. San Francisco, CA
*/

async function action(args) {
    return { "traffic": "normal" }
}

export { action }
```

Run `lm update` to register the new actions tools.

Now let's declare those tools in a `toolsexample.yml` task:

```yaml
description: Tools use example
prompt: |-
    {prompt}
template:
    afterSystem: |-
        
        You are an AI touristic assistant
ctx: 8192
model:
    name: qwen3:4b
    template: chatml-tools
inferParams:
    top_k: 20
    top_p: 0.95
    min_p: 0
    temperature: 0.2
    max_tokens: 4096
toolsList:
    - weather # from the tool declared in actions/weather.py
    - traffic # from the tool declared in actions/traffic.js
```

Run `lm update` to register the task and then run the command:

```bash
lm toolsexample "I am landing in Barcelona soon: I plan to reach my hotel and then go for outdoor sport. \
How are the conditions in the city?"
```

Output of <kbd>Qwen 3 4b</kbd>:

```
⚒️  Executing [toolsexample] weather { city: 'Barcelona' }
⚒️  Executing [toolsexample] traffic { city: 'Barcelona' }
The weather in Barcelona is currently 18°C with rain, so you might want to consider indoor sports if you're planning outdoor activities. Traffic conditions are normal, so you should have no issues with getting around the city. Let me know if you need further assistance! 🌂🌧️
```

## System actions tools

A system action can be a task. Example:

```yaml
tool:
  description: Get documentation from an `man` page for a given shell command
  arguments:
    command:
        description: "The command name. Example: `find` or `chmod`"
cmd: man
args:
  - "-P"
  - "cat"
```

## Tasks tools

A task can be a tool. Example:

```yaml
tool:
    description: "Evaluate a shell command's' correctness and security. Provides a confidency score between 0.0 and 1.0 for both correctness and security"
    arguments:
        prompt: 
            description: The initial user request
        command: 
            description: The command to analyze
# ...
```
