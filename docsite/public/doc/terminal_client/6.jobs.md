# Jobs

A job is a pipeline of tasks and actions that run in a sequence. A job
is defined in yaml.

Example `features/jobs/commit_msg.yml` job that uses
the `features/actions/git_diff.js` action and the `features/tasks/commit_msg.yml` task:

```yaml
title: "Generate a git commit message from a git diff"
tasks:
  - type: "action"
    name: "git_diff"
  - type: "task"
    name: "commit_msg"
```

Note: the result of an action or task is passed to the next one.
