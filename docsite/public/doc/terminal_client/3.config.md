# Config

The custom features (tasks, jobs, actions and commands) are located either
in a local folder or in a js plugin.

Before the first run you must declare your custom features in a config file.
Create a `features/config.yml` file:

```yml
promptfile: /home/me/lm/features/src/prompt.txt
features:
  - /home/me/lm/features/dist
plugins:
  - "@docdundee/agent"
  - "@agent-smith/feat-git"
```

Update your client config using this file by running this command:

```bash
lm conf ~/lm/features/config.yml
```

## Local features

The features are declared in a folder (here `/home/me/lm/features/dist`) using
these subfolders:

- actions
- cmds
- jobs
- tasks

All are optional.

## Update features

Once you have declared your features folder with the command above you
can add new ones and update your client config.

For example if we add a `features/dist/tasks/git_commit.yml` task we need
to update the client config for the new task to be available:

```bash
lm update
```

Note: all the features are loaded dynamically, so if you modify a feature you
don't need to run the update again: it will work immediatly
