description: Write a shell command
prompt: |-
      We requested another AI to write a shell command. Initial user request: "{prompt}"

      The AI created this command:

      {command}

      Analyze the user request and review the command to check for:

      - **Correctness**: the command must do exactly what is requested by the user. Verify that it does it all correctly
      - Security problems if this command is run: only check for serious problems      
      - Simplicity and best practices: suggest alternatives if you find a better way to do what the user requested

      Provide a confidency score between 0.0 and 1.0 in you final report for:

      - Correctness
      - Security

      Suggest the good command if the correctness score is not 1.0
